							<p>Background and aims: SHIELD Illinois (or SHIELD) developed an innovative saliva-based COVID-19 test. 
								Recognizing the importance of media as sources of information for the public at times of crisis such as 
								the COVID-19 pandemic, next to providing COVID-19 testing, SHIELD developed and shared campaigns on social and mass media encouraging community-wide testing.
								 This project aimed to understand the effectiveness of SHIELD Illinois' communication about its efforts in terms of media and public response.  </a>.</p>
							
							<p>We applied persuasive and health communication theories and built on the agenda-setting power of both news and social media to: 
								(1) analyze the impact of the SHIELD Illinois activities on public perceptions and media coverage and (2) understand the diffusion of information about SHIELD Illinois. </p>
							<p>Methods: Our analysis used a broad range of news and social media platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, as well as engagement data from SHIELD’s account holders, which we supplemented with meta data obtained from news databases and platform APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of user engagement. We also used SHIELD’s testing data to compare media engagement and testing patterns. </p>	
							<p>Key findings: 
								1 SHIELD testing, although present across the state, was unevenly distributed with the Chicagoland area dominating. The uptake in testing fluctuated over time. 
								2 Most media coverage of SHIELD happened in local state news. Notable national outlets that discussed SHIELD included Politico, The New York Times, NPR, and The Wall Street Journal. 
								3 We identified Twitter accounts that SHIELD tried to engage with, or vice versa, and whether these were reciprocated and noted an imbalance in SHIELD's community engagement and outreach. Engagement with SHIELD developed over time: while SHIELD was most active in the early stages, the community engaged with SHIELD more later during the pandemic. 
								4 We also found that communication coming from SHIELD and around SHIELD had a positive sentiment. However, there were comments that were negative, even anti-testing.</p>

					<!-- Project motivation -->
						<article id="project-motivation">
							<h2 class="major">Project Motivation</h2>
							<p>SHIELD Illinois (or SHIELD) is an organization behind an innovative saliva-based COVID-19 test. It provides COVID-19 testing, encourages community-wide testing, and helps public health agencies understand the prevalence, contagiousness, and mortality of the disease. The challenge of conducting COVID-19 testing is no longer about inadequate testing capacity but inadequate uptake, due to pandemic fatigue and test anxiety (McDermott & Newman, 2020). To increase the effectiveness of pro-testing campaigns, it is important to understand the dissemination and reach of such messages and the recipients’ perceptions.</p>
							<p>Media are an important source of information for the public, especially during health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, managing communication and providing adequate health literacy messages is difficult in the contemporary media environment where social media and news media co-exist and can co-shape public agendas (Vargo & Guo, 2017), which can subsequently influence the public’s acceptance of vaccines or willingness to test (Ashkenazi et al., 2020; McDermott & Newman, 2020).</p>
							<p>SHIELD Illinois attempted to establish a presence on social media and gain news media coverage. Thus, it became important to understand not only what messages SHIELD Illinois broadcasted but also how the public discussed SHIELD Illinois, how they engaged with its messaging, and how communications about SHIELD Illinois diffused among social networks beyond engaging with its direct communications. Informed by persuasive and health communication and the agenda-setting power of both news and social media, this project was undertaken with the aim to understand the effectiveness of SHIELD Illinois’ communication about its efforts in terms of public response.</p>
							<p>Specifically, this project was driven by three research goals: </p>
							<p>To analyze the impact of the SHIELD Illinois activities on public perceptions and media coverage by answering the following questions: 
								How did social media users react to SHIELD Illinois? 
								What themes dominated the discourse around SHIELD Illinois? 
								What was the media coverage (local and national press) of SHIELD Illinois? 
								To understand the diffusion of information about SHIELD Illinois: 
								Did SHIELD Illinois manage to create a network that would help it diffuse information? 
								Did the information reach the most influential audiences in order to effectively diffuse it further?  </p>

						<article id="method">
							<h2 class="major">Method</h2>
							
							<p>Methodological Approach
								This project examines SHIELD Illinois’ digital communication and its associations with COVID-19 testing numbers. Our analysis encompasses a broad range of news and social media platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit. SHIELD provided us with engagement data from its account holders, which we supplemented with meta data obtained from news databases and platform APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of user engagement. Below we describe our data collection procedures.</p>
							<p>Testing data 
								Testing data used in this project began at the end of November 2020 and ended in September 2022. There were 94 weeks of data from all testing sites in Illinois. Although the saliva test began on the UIUC campus in July 2020, our data were limited to the community rollout of the SHIELD Illinois saliva testing.<p>
							<p>News coverage data
								News coverage of SHIELD Illinois was gathered using LexisNexis, Newsbank, and Google News. No single platform gave us a comprehensive list of articles; therefore, we combined the results from these three different sources. There were issues with duplicate stories, republished stories, and missing stories from larger news outlets or public media organizations. We used keywords such as “SHIELD Illinois” and “COVID-19” to find news articles from August 2020 to December 2022. LexisNexis and Newsbank were available to us through the university. We first searched for stories through LexisNexis, yielding only 120 articles after duplicates were removed. This number was lower than expected and did not include national outlets that we knew covered SHIELD Illinois. We conducted a search on Newsbank and this search was more thorough, with about 500 articles. However, some national stories were still missing, hence we used Google News to find the larger media outlets like Politico and The New York Times. 
								<p>		
							<p>Marketing efforts: influencers
								SHIELD hired three Chicago athletes for their testing campaigns. Two were on the women's soccer team, the Chicago Red Stars. Kayla Sharples, a defender for the team, is an Illinois native, originally from Naperville. She attended Northwestern University for soccer. Though she appeared in SHIELD promotions, Sharples did not promote them on Instagram or Twitter. She liked a Tweet from SHIELD mentioning herself. The other Red Stars player, Kealia Watt, midfielder and forward, was on the team from 2020 to 2021. She is originally from Utah and married to football player J.J. Watt, who played for the Texans. Watt also did not post or Tweet anything related to SHIELD. The last influencer hired was former Cubs player Wilson Contreras. He is a catcher and three-time All Star. Contreras was born in Venezuela and attended a Chicago Cubs-run baseball academy in the country when he was 16. Contreras is a popular player, making headlines when he switched to playing for the St. Louis Cardinals. Like Watt and Sharples, Contreras never posted or Tweeted about SHIELD Illinois.
								<p>	
							<p>Social media data<p>
							<p>Twitter: 
								SHIELD Illinois was active on Twitter. We extracted Twitter data using Twitter’s academic API. Twitter can provide rich information about people’s thoughts and feelings about COVID-19 testing, serving as a great starting point for the investigation (Paul et al., 2014). 
								We applied social network analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to the Twitter data (see Findings). Social network analysis is the process of exploring social structures via networks and graph theory (see, e.g., Otte & Rousseau, 2002). It reveals the communication between SHIELD Illinois and the Twitter community. We also explored how networks changed over time to better understand the diffusion of health-related information and the change in online engagement. Topic modeling can help organize a large collection of documents by grouping them into different themes. It provides a quantitative account of the topics that the public discusses/engages with. Finally, we used Twitter data to understand the audience’s sentiments, including positive and negative feelings, joy, anger, fear, and trust (Ali et al., 2017; Zarrad et al., 2014).  <p>
							<p>YouTube: 
								SHIELD Illinois maintained a YouTube channel with 29 videos published between April 23, 2021 and April 11, 2022. On average, the videos received 3.55 likes (SD = 7.29) and 932 views (SD = 2,462) during this one-year period. The most popular video, “SHIELD Illinois K-12 Schools Collection Examples” (4:22 in length), received 33 likes and 13,221 views. This video showcased two methods for K-12 schools to collect saliva samples for SHIELD Illinois’ COVID-19 test. The second most popular video, “SHIELD Illinois: How the Saliva-Based PCR Test Works” (4:12 in length), received 25 likes and 2,824 views. It demonstrated the step-by-step process that a saliva sample goes through in the PCR testing process, from entering the lab to being disposed of as biohazardous waste. Most videos were brief, with four webinars lasting between 30 minutes and an hour discussing COVID-19 variants, assessing COVID-19 risks for indoor settings, and the effects of long COVID-19. Most videos disabled the commenting function, with only one video receiving a comment asking for assistance in accessing test results online. Therefore, we could not derive meaningful audience engagement/interaction from videos. <p>					 
							<p>Facebook: 
								Between March 01, 2021, and September 22, 2022, SHIELD Illinois maintained a Facebook page where they published 153 posts. On average, each post reached out to 514 people (SD = 1,578) and received 10 likes and reactions (SD = 17.00), 1.6 comments (SD = 11.56), and 2 shares (SD = 3.90) during the 18-month period. The most popular post, “If you haven't gotten your post-travel COVID-19 test yet, now’s the time. Don’t wait until you experience symptoms. Be proactive to interrupt the spread!” was published on January 4, 2022 and reached 19,096 Facebook users. It received 181 likes, 143 comments, and 5 shares. This post directed users to the SHIELD Illinois’ website, which provided information about the hours and locations of their testing sites around Illinois. The second most popular post, published on November 18, 2021, encouraged people to help squash COVID-19 before it can spread during Thanksgiving. The post included a flyer that informed users about the nearest testing sites and their hours of operation. Most of the posts on SHIELD Illinois’s Facebook page aimed to promote the importance of getting tested for COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the virus. They offered information about the availability of free testing in different communities, provided educational resources such as webinars, news articles, and presentations from experts to help people understand the different COVID-19 variants and how to prevent their spread, and expressed gratitude to their team and partners for their work in keeping Illinois safe. Facebook data can be sometimes accessed using Facebook’s CrowdTangle. However, in this case, SHIELD Illinois’s Facebook page was not completely public, making it impossible for us to gather the data due to privacy constraints. Therefore, it was not possible to derive meaningful audience engagement/interaction data from the Facebook page.
								<p>
							<p>Instagram: 
								SHIELD Illinois was present on Instagram and until today has gathered 293 followers and has made 166 posts. We used Facebook’s CrowdTangle to access SHIELD Illinois’ account. SHIELD Illinois posted 161 times between April 22, 2021, and November 22, 2022. The posts were mainly photos, but there were also some videos. They mostly included pictures of tests and testing staff as well as infographics encouraging the audience to get tested. SHIELD has been also tagged in a couple of "sponsored" posts too but not by the influencers they worked with. Since CrowdTangle does not provide access to comments or following accounts for privacy reasons, we did not analyze Instagram. <p>
							<p>Reddit: 
								Upon searching on Reddit, we were unable to find any relevant conversations posted by SHIELD Illinois. However, there were several relevant discussions posted by universities and communities that mentioned SHIELD. Among them, the most popular conversation was posted by the UIUC community, receiving 487 upvotes and 30 comments. This post announced that SHIELD had received FDA approval for its saliva-based COVID-19 test for the campus. The second and third most popular posts were posted by University of Chicago and a Chicago suburbs community, respectively. Both posts mentioned SHIELD in the context of providing information regarding COVID-19 test sites.

						<article id="finding">
							<h2 class="major">Finding</h2>
							<p> Before presenting findings related to each of our research goals, we provide our analysis of testing data provided to us by SHIELD Illinois.</p>
							<p>COVID-19 Testing in Illinois </p>
							<p> SHIELD Illinois established its presence across the state. SHIELD testing occurred in all regions of the state, with a concentration in the Chicagoland area (see Figure 1). Zip codes outside of the Chicagoland area had somewhat lower total tests, ranging from a few hundred to a few thousands. In the Chicagoland area, the greatest concentration of a high number of tests was in the northern suburbs, such as Highland Park, Northbrook, Wheeling, and Des Plaines. The highest number of tests occurred in zip code 61761, with over 500,000 total tests. This data point was excluded because it is an outlier. The second-highest number of tests was in zip code 60540, which comprises most of Naperville, Illinois.</p>
