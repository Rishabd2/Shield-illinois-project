							<p>Background and aims: SHIELD Illinois (or SHIELD) developed an innovative saliva-based COVID-19 test. 
								Recognizing the importance of media as sources of information for the public at times of crisis such as 
								the COVID-19 pandemic, next to providing COVID-19 testing, SHIELD developed and shared campaigns on social and mass media encouraging community-wide testing.
								 This project aimed to understand the effectiveness of SHIELD Illinois’ communication about its efforts in terms of media and public response.  </a>.</p>
							
							<p>We applied persuasive and health communication theories and built on the agenda-setting power of both news and social media to: 
								(1) analyze the impact of the SHIELD Illinois activities on public perceptions and media coverage and (2) understand the diffusion of information about SHIELD Illinois. </p>
							<p>Methods: Our analysis used a broad range of news and social media platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, as well as engagement data from SHIELD’s account holders, which we supplemented with meta data obtained from news databases and platform APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of user engagement. We also used SHIELD’s testing data to compare media engagement and testing patterns. </p>	
							<p>Key findings: 
								1) SHIELD testing, although present across the state, was unevenly distributed with the Chicagoland area dominating. The uptake in testing fluctuated over time. 
								2) Most media coverage of SHIELD happened in local state news. Notable national outlets that discussed SHIELD included Politico, The New York Times, NPR, and The Wall Street Journal. 
								3) We identified Twitter accounts that SHIELD tried to engage with, or vice versa, and whether these were reciprocated and noted an imbalance in SHIELD’s community engagement and outreach. Engagement with SHIELD developed over time: while SHIELD was most active in the early stages, the community engaged with SHIELD more later during the pandemic. 
								4) We also found that communication coming from SHIELD and around SHIELD had a positive sentiment. However, there were comments that were negative, even anti-testing.

						<article id="project-motivation">
							<h2 class="major">Project Motivation</h2>
							<p>SHIELD Illinois (or SHIELD) is an organization behind an innovative saliva-based COVID-19 test. It provides COVID-19 testing, encourages community-wide testing, and helps public health agencies understand the prevalence, contagiousness, and mortality of the disease. The challenge of conducting COVID-19 testing is no longer about inadequate testing capacity but inadequate uptake, due to pandemic fatigue and test anxiety (McDermott & Newman, 2020). To increase the effectiveness of pro-testing campaigns, it is important to understand the dissemination and reach of such messages and the recipients’ perceptions.</p>
							<p>Media are an important source of information for the public, especially during health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, managing communication and providing adequate health literacy messages is difficult in the contemporary media environment where social media and news media co-exist and can co-shape public agendas (Vargo & Guo, 2017), which can subsequently influence the public’s acceptance of vaccines or willingness to test (Ashkenazi et al., 2020; McDermott & Newman, 2020).</p>
							<p>SHIELD Illinois attempted to establish a presence on social media and gain news media coverage. Thus, it became important to understand not only what messages SHIELD Illinois broadcasted but also how the public discussed SHIELD Illinois, how they engaged with its messaging, and how communications about SHIELD Illinois diffused among social networks beyond engaging with its direct communications. Informed by persuasive and health communication and the agenda-setting power of both news and social media, this project was undertaken with the aim to understand the effectiveness of SHIELD Illinois’ communication about its efforts in terms of public response.</p>
							<p>Specifically, this project was driven by three research goals: </p>
							<p>To analyze the impact of the SHIELD Illinois activities on public perceptions and media coverage by answering the following questions: 
								How did social media users react to SHIELD Illinois? 
								What themes dominated the discourse around SHIELD Illinois? 
								What was the media coverage (local and national press) of SHIELD Illinois? 
								To understand the diffusion of information about SHIELD Illinois: 
								Did SHIELD Illinois manage to create a network that would help it diffuse information? 
								Did the information reach the most influential audiences in order to effectively diffuse it further?  </p>
